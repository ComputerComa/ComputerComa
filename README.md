### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm ComputerComa

Helpdesk Technician | Hobbyist Software Developer | Avid Gamer

I'm a full time helpdesk technician that likes to dabble in Software Development and enjoys playing video games in my free time. 
I enjoy developing in HTML, CSS, Javascript, a little PHP, node.js (discord.js and a little express.js), Python, and Visual Basic .net and Lua (Factorio Mods).

That's really all that there is to know about me. If your interested in getting in contact with me you can find me on most social media platforms.
